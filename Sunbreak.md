# Sunbreak API

This documentation is for developers who want to use the Sunbreak APIs. There are 2 separate APIs:

1.    REST - standard method of creating data tables, pick lists, etc.

2.    Sockets – better for real time updates, perfect for Gutenberg blocks.

<br/>

The documentation here explores all of the methods and end points available, and includes code snippets for:

1.    JavaScript

2.    NODEJS

3.    PHP

We really hope that this documentation will encourage WordPress developers to create awesome additions to their sites. If there’s anything you want us to add, just submit a ticket from https://help.Sunbreak.com/submit-a-ticket/.
